## What is Solidly

- Solidly is an AMM, allows swapping between two tokens
- Supports low slippage trade between stablecoins

## Tokens

- SOLID
  - Earned if you provide liquidity in a whitelisted pool (incentivized)

- veSOLID
  - Governance token
  - non-transferable
  - Lock period from 1 week to 4 years
  - Vote for a pool to be incentivized
  - Accumulate **ALL PROTOCOL FEES** of pools they **VOTED FOR**

- Liquidity Providers receive SOLID & trading fees are given to those who vote for it
- If the pool is not whitelisted and does not have a gague, trading fees go to liquidity providers

## Emissions

- Circulating supply = Total supply - Locked supply
- Weekly emissions ares adjusted as a percentage of CIRCULATING SUPPLY
  - If 0% of SOLID is LOCKED as veSOLID -> emission is 100%
  - If 50% of SOLID is LOCKED as veSOLID -> emission is 50%
  - If 100% of SOLID is LOCKED as veSOLID -> emission is 0%

- veSOLID lockers increase their holdings proportional to the weekly emission
  - If weekly emissions is 5%, veSOLID increase their holdings 5%.
  - Never diluted

## Fees distribution

- Simple goal, emissions go to the liquidity with the highest fees
  - EX: as a veCRV holder, you will receive 50% of all fees, regardless of where you vote for emissions to go
  - You might vote your emissions onto a pool that generates 0 fees for the protocol AND STILL earn rewards of fees generated by other pools

- Fees earned by the protocol go to veSOLID owners
- Emissions by the protocol go to pools with the highest fees
- veSOLID owners decide which pools receive emissions
- veSOLID owners receive fees ONLY for pools they voted for

### Benefits

1. Incentivizes fees for the protocol, meaning higher payouts for veSOLID owners
2. Emissions will promote the highest fee earning pools, and this will increase liquidity on those pools meaning better rates
3. Aligns emissions with protocol incentives

### Fees explored

1. Pay fees in an asset not correlated to the primary system asset (like CRV that pays in stable)

2. SOLID does not distribute fees in the naive token (buyback) or as a stable (sell pressure). Instead as the asset in which the fee was accrued (MORE INFO IN THIS, I DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND IT)

Let’s say you launch a new stable coin, and you incentivize liquidity for your coin + MIM in Curve (you give extra rewards), your protocol is paying for liquidity, however, your protocol doesn’t earn fees, Curve earns fees.

3. Whomever owns the LP token, earns the fees

## Boosting & bribes

- Based on how much veSOLID a user owns, they may be able to receive up to 2.5x more SOLID rewards
- On Solidly its possible for anyone to attach bribes onto a gauge and those who vote for it are then able to claim them

## NOTES

1. Projects receiving the veSOLID will own 25% of the protocol in perpetuity
2. Fees are paid out in base assets, not converted

## Solidly summary

1. AMM, allows swap between tokens with low slippage
2. SOLIDLY token -> SOLID
3. SOLIDLY Governance token -> veSOLID(vote-escrow SOLID)

4. SOLID
   1. Earned for providing liquidity

5. veSOLID
   1. NON-transferable
   2. Lock period: 1week to 4 years
   3. Get **all fees** from pools they voted for
   4. Increase their holdings proportional to weekly emissions (rebase, non-dilutive)
      1. If weekly emissions is 5% -> **veSOLID HOLDERS** increase their holdings 5%
      2. Projects receiving the veSOLID will own 25% of protocol in perpetuity
   5. Able to receive up to 2.5x more SOLID rewards
   6. Get bribes

6. Emissions
   1. SOLID Weekly emissions are adjusted as a percentage of **CIRCULATING SUPPLY**
      1. Circulating supply = Total supply - Locked supply
      2. If 0% of **SOLID** is **LOCKED** as **veSOLID** -> EMISSIONS is 100%
      3. If 100% of **SOLID** is **LOCKED** as **veSOLID** -> EMISSIONS is 0%
