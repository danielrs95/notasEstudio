# Prep

## Intro

- My name is Daniel, im 27, I'm an engineer and I consider myself a pretty normal person I think, I like working out going out with friends to eat or just chat with them.

- A big hobbie that I have besides working out is studying, Im constantly trying to learn more thinks or learn deeper something I already know. for example this past months I've been reading some books about JS

- Discipline beats talent

1. Talking about some projects I have had work on I

    - One of my first projects was an API to read some data from IMDB to practice rendering on react lists an so on
    - I made an ecommerce with Mongo, React, Express and Node this was like 1 year ago when I was learning react and redux
    - Last week I made a technical inVterview, I had to do a note app but with a framework wich I had never used
        - Nest
        - TypeORM
        - And I practice redux using redux toolkit wich I believe is an awesome abstraction

    - Currently Im working as a full stack engineer for a company and we are making an app to map informal sellers, like they personal informatio, location etc
        -  The backend is made with Play framework but made with JAva API, Akka Streams and Ebean ORM
        -  The front is made with Nextjs, react and state managed with redux

2. __Design patterns__

    1. __Creational__ -> How objects are created

        - Singleton -> Object than can only be instantiated once. Like a objects settings for global properties
        - Prototype -> Fancy word for _clone_. Prototype delegation
        - Builder -> Builds complex objects using simple objects and step by step approach
        - Factory -> We create object without exposing the creation logic to the client

    2. __Structural__ -> How objects are relate to each other

        - Facade -> Add an interface to existing one to hide its complexities, the class provides simplified methods required by the client
        - Proxy ->

    3. __Behavioral__ -> How objects communicate with each other

        - Iterator -> To get a way to access the elements of a collection object in sequential manner
        - Observer -> One-to-many between objects, if one is modified, the many other are notified
        - Mediator -> Reduce communication complexity between multiple objects or classes
        - State -> Object behave different according to his state

3. __Clean code__ -> Robert C Martin

    <!-- - Sin comentarios -->
    <!-- - El codigo deberia ser leible, entenderse solo -->
    - Meaningfull names
    - Write code that express intent
    - No comments
    - Leave the code better than you find it
    - Single responsibility principle
    - Write test
    - Practice

4. __YAGNI__ -> You are gonna need it
    - Write code that you're gonna need, not forseing future

5. __KISS__ -> Keep It Simple, Stupid
    - Most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than complicated

6. __Branching strategy__ -> How to control flow of coding

7. __Data Structures__
    - Arrays
    - Linked Lists -> Sequence of items in linear order which are linked to each other
    - Stacks -> Last In First Out, like a pile of plates
    - Quees -> First In First Out
    - Hash Tables -> Stores values which have keys associated with each of them. Map kets to values
    - Trees -> Data is organized hierarchically
    - Heap -> Special case of tree, compare to their childer with their values and are arranged accordingly
    - Graphs -> Set of vertices/nodes and edges connecting these vertices
