## Built-in Type Methods

The built-in types and subtypes have behaviors exposed as properties and methods that are quite powerful and useful

Briefly, there is a _String_ object wrapper form typically called a _native_ that pairs with the primitive _string type_, this object wrapper is the one that defines the methods and properties

Ejemplo:

  ```js
  var a = "hello world";
  var b = 3.14159;
  a.length; // 11
  a.toUpperCase(); // "HELLO WORLD"
  b.toFixed(4); // "3.1416"
  ```

  When you use a primitive value like "hello world" as an object by referencing a property or method (e.g., a.toUpperCase() in the previous snippet)

  JS automatically “boxes” the value to its object wrapper counterpart (hidden under the covers)

A _string_ value can be wrapped by a _String object_

A _number_ can be wrapped by a _Number object_

A _boolean_ can be wrapped by a _Boolean object_

## Comparing Values

There are two main types of value comparison that you will need to make in your JS programs

1. equality
2. inequality

The result of any comparison is a strictly boolean value

### Coercion

Comes in two forms in JavaScript: _explicit_ and _implicit_

```js
// Explicit
var a = "42"
var b = Number(a)

a; // "42"
b; // 42
```

```js
var a = '42'
var b = a * 1 // "42" implicitly coerced to 42

a; // "42"
b; // 42
```

### Truthy & falsy

1. _Falsy_
    1. "" (empty string)
    2. 0, -0, NaN (invalid number)
    3. null, undefined
    4. false

2. _Truthy_
    Any value thats not falsy, is truthy

A non-boolean value only follow truthy/false coercion if it's actually coerced to a _boolean_

### Equality

The difference between `==` and `===` is that `==` allows coercion when checking for value equality

```js
var a = "42";
var b = 42;
a == b; // true
a === b; // false
```

## Function Scopes

You use the _var_ keyword to declare a variable that will belong to the current function scope, or the global scope if at the top level outside of any function

_Hoisting_ wherever a _var_ appears inside a scope, that declaration is taken to belong to the entire scope and accesible everywhere throughout

Metaphorically, this behavior is called _hoisting_, when a _var_ declaration is conceptually "moved" to the top of its enclosing scope

```js
var a = 2

foo(); // works because foo() declaration is "hoisted"

function foo() {
  a = 3;
  console.log(a) // 3
  var a;
}
console.log(a) // 2
```

### Nested scopes
