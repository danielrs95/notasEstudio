## Guide to DYOR

There's a propose of 2 frameworks of thinking:

1. An _internal framework_ for the mind to keep our humanity in check
    This requires to look inward and build an iron-clad logical mindset

2. An _external framework_ to apply on the subject we want to learn
    Looks to break-down systems, approaching them from different levels of complexity

### Building our kingdom of logic

1. _Self-awareness/control_

    We have to understand our limitations
    What are our strengths?
    Why are we in crypto?
    Are we trying to play the game of DeFi passively?

    Self-awareness and control are represented by the _noblehouse_ of our kingdom and represent its nucleus

2. _Information filter_

    The walls of our kingdom represent the information filter that protects us from the thousands of daily supposed alpha

    Information for the sake of it, without knowing how to evaluate it and assimilate it will simply exhaust our judgment

3. _Theory testing_

    We have to test observing new data, testing new processes and recording the outcomes, this are our farmlands outside of our kingdom

#### Noble House Construction

Self-awareness is hard-work because it leaves us vulnerable to our harshest critic, ourselves. Generally, humans hate being wrong

BUT the most successful investors and traders will generally say they feel the most confident in a strategy when they completely pivot on a thesis after realizing the _were wrong_

In markets and in the face of randomness there is no absolute truth

The game is ever-changing and so the goal is to be as close to the truth as possible

An investment or trading strategy is a probabilistic theory and we need to be constantly looking to disprove it

    It is extremely dangerous to contemplate HODLing or diamond handing any asset as a serious investment thesis because it _implicitly disregards_ the possibility of our thesis being wrong

Our conviction leves should be strong to invest into something but we should beware marrying our bags and preachers of such. This will help tremendously in taking profits and cutting loses

#### Fortifying the walls

We need the ability to disprove theories

The _scientific method_ is literally making observations, formulating a theory and attempting to disprove it until we have exhausted the potential invalidating points. _ONLY THEN_ will a theory be taken seriously

_The problem of induction_ is make a general, ampliative inference from multiple self-reinforcing events

  No amount of observations of _white swans_ can allow the inference that all swans are white, but the observation of a _single black swan_ is sufficient to refute that conclusion.

_The problem of outliers and their statistical relevance_, if the one black swan appears:

  Then we know _FOR CERTAIN_ that all swans are not white

Practically, investing and trading cannot be done deterministically. Even in high-levels physics, models are composed of approximations and involve almost only probabilities

1. Invalidations are key
2. You should _constantly_ look to evaluate pieces of information through deductive reasoning, searching for invalidations
3. If theory can not be disproven, it is a strong theory

We have to try not to fall victim of _self-reinforcing biases_, we are humans and guilty of feeling some sort of exhilaration when someone else is reaffirming our own beliefs

_Reflexivity_ is when self-reinforcing theses propagate through enough market participants that they end up happening

#### Farmland Innovations

For most of us, it's only by putting to test our theories that we can conclude if it's of any value to us

  If our goal is to become _self-sovereign thinkers_, having skin in the game is imperative

How do you evaluate skill versus luck in probability? -> Evaluate the power of alternative outcomes

If you have 90% of making $1 and 10% of losing $10K this is a loss

  0.9x1 - 0.1x10000 = -$999.1

Although you have 90% chance of making money, the result of that 10% makes that over time, those great odds will lead you broke

### Four levels of Systematic Thinking

There are 4 levels of thinking and we can divide them like so:

1. _The Serf_
    Learning the rules of the game you want to specialize in, broadly defining different ecosystems, participants concepts

    - What is an LP?
    - What is impermanent loss?

2. _The Knight_
    Learning how to play the game, approaching DeFi relationships between dependent variables without abstracting at all

    - Why is there a correlation between impermanent loss and volatility?

3. _The Lord_
    The meta of DeFi. Learning about hidden subgame and where the rules are hidden and constantly change

    Taking more complex dependencies and abstracting more

    Thinking dynamically, the introduction to understanding the effects of the thinking participant

    - Knowing that supply dynamics and volatility have an influence on impermanent loss and dilution:

      1. What set of behaviors would be reflected in liquidity pool X?
      2. What set of decisions would liquidity provider Y make?
      3. How does the subsequent actions of Y influence X again?
      4. Are there any alternative outcomes in behavior for both LP X and actor Y?
      5. Would an alternative outcome in X provide a whole new set of alternative outcomes for Y?

4. _The King_
    Learning how to write your own rulebook and repeating the preceding process to create a never-ending feedback loop of scrutiny

    It's the application of know or new theories and the methodologies to challenge the developed consensus on a subject

    For example: Applying the Theory of Reflexivity to Liquidity Providing Dynamics.

    If we acknowledge the glaring information asymmetry in DeFi, in addition to general human fallibility, it can be argued that in the face of uncertainty/volatility, reflexivity in asset pricing will extend itself in Liquidity Pool dynamics and impact as well.
    Reflexivity in a nutshell:

    Price moves → change in perception → price moves more → more changes in perception →(…)

    1. How does reflexivity challenge our notions of LP dynamics, impermanent loss, dilution?
    2. How does the very nature of the blockchainBlockchains are made up of a series of individual blocks. Each block contains information about transactions conducted within a given time period. The… More, the accessibility of information and the architecture of LP smart contracts, challenge the concept of reflexivity?
    3. How can we accurately measure the distribution of information in markets? Is it possible?
    4. How can we accurately measure the mean amounts of bias, subjectivity and human error for each decision in markets?

In the end its up to us to decide how to go about it, some people like to start small before they go big.

Real learning and researching is about asking good questions, effective DYOR is about developing our ability to constantly ask the right questions
