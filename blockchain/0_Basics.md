There's a propose of 2 frameworks of thinking:

1. An _internal framework_ for the mind to keep our humanity in check
    This requires to look inward and build an iron-clad logical mindset

2. An _external framework_ to apply on the subject we want to learn
    Looks to break-down systems, approaching them from different levels of complexity

### Building our kingdom of logic

1. _Self-awareness/control_

    We have to understand our limitations
    What are our strengths?
    Why are we in crypto?
    Are we trying to play the game of DeFi passively?

    Self-awareness and control are represented by the _noblehouse_ of our kingdom and represent its nucleus

2. _Information filter_

    The walls of our kingdom represent the information filter that protects us from the thousands of daily supposed alpha

    Information for the sake of it, without knowing how to evaluate it and assimilate it will simply exhaust our judgment

3. _Theory testing_

    We have to test observing new data, testing new processes and recording the outcomes

#### Noble House Construction

Self-awareness is hard-work because it leaves us vulnerable to our harshest critic, ourselves. Generally, humans hate being wrong

BUT the most successful investors and traders will generally say they feel the most confident in a strategy when they completely pivot on a thesis after realizing the _were wrong_

In markets and in the face of randomness there is no absolute truth

The game is ever-changing and so the goal is to be as close to the truth as possible

An investment or trading strategy is a probabilistic theory and we need to be constantly looking to disprove it

    It is extremely dangerous to contemplate HODLing or diamond handing any asset as a serious investment thesis because it _implicitly disregards_ the possibility of our thesis being wrong

Our conviction leves should be strong to invest into something but we should beware marrying our bags and preachers of such. This will help tremendously in taking profits and cutting loses
