# 0xDAO

- Aims to become THE YIELD HUB for solidly on fantom

## Partner treatment

Projects who deposit their veNFT(veSOLID) with 0xDAO prior to launch will receive:

- SOLIDLY trading fees (remember they are paid in the asset the fee was accrued )
- Bribe rewards
- Non-dilutive oxSOLID (fractionalized representation of 0xDAO's veSOLID)
- SOLID emissions shared from protocol LPs
- OXD emissions

- When partner's deposit veSOLID, they receive a proportional amount of oxSOLID
  - 0xDAO automatically converts rebased SOLID into oxSOLID
  - Remember, veSOLID lockers increase their holding proportional to the weekly emissions
  - oxSOLID lockers increase their holding proportional to the weekly emissions!

- Partners will earn OXD proportional to how much of the oxSOLID total supply they hold (just like SOLID ?)

- vlOXD (vote locked OXD) receives bribes and controls 0xDAO voting, to maintain their share of OXD emissions, governance control and bribe share
  - Continue to lock their SOLID rewards for oxSOLID
  - Lock their OXD for vlOXD

## OXD v1 token holders

Token holders are partners, will be able to burn OXD v1 for oxSOLID, and this can be staked on 0xDAO

oxSOLID **STAKERS** can earn all partner treatment told above and

1. Solidly protocol fees
2. Bribes
3. Non-dilutive benefit from veSOLID
4. Boosted SOLID emissions from LPs (equating to 10% of emissions) -> OXD v2 emissions ?
5. OXD emissions

## MEDIUM # 2

- OXDv1 is a fractional representation of 0xDAO veSOLID (veNFT)

oxSOLID = (OXDv1 burned / OXDv1 circulating supply) * SOLID in 0xDAO veNFT

OXDv1 supply ~ 910M
0xDAO veSOLID ~ 2376588

1 oxSOLID = 382.9 OXDv1

- OXD = OXDv2
- OXD will reward LPs and SOLID lockers

- Current partners have and 37% of all locked SOLID
  - 37% of 25% SOLID TOTAL SUPPLY
  - Remember, veSOLID owners percentage is non-dilutive!

### oxSOLID

- oxSOLID is minted 1:1 to SOLID & veSOLID (pegged to SOLID)
- non-dilutive as veSOLID
- 10% share of SOLID earned by 0xDAO protocol LPs, as SOLID
- Claim veSOLID airdrops
- oxSOLID stakers will earn whichever number is greater between the FLOOR (5%) and the next formula.  This number **DOES NOT** have a limit

OXD Earned = (Current oxSOLID staked / Total SOLID)

#### Partner benefits

Partners receive a minimum floor percentage of OXD emissions calculated as

Floor partner = 2 * (Initial oxSOLID staked / TOTAL SOLID)

OXD emissions allocated to partner **have a maximum** total floor of 25% of all OXD emissions. Once the combined partner floor reaches 25%, the floor of the OXD emissions will be:

Floor partner = Partner initial oxSOLID / (Total Partner Initial Solid * 0.25)

## LP Benefits

- Earn SOLID with a high boost without locking any SOLID
- Earn OXD rewards based on SOLID earned
- Liquidity providers for 0xDAO pairs (oxSOLID/SOLID & OXD/WFTM) can earn and additional 0-5% platform fee in oxSOLID (initially 0%)

## OXD Overview

- OXD is the governance token for 0xDAO
- OXD locked for 16 weeks -> vote-locked OXD (vlOXD)

- vlOXD
  - Decides how 0xDAO allocates its veSOLID on Solidly gauge weight votes
  - Receives 5% of 0xDAO LP SOLID yield as oxSOLID
  - Receives vlOXD bribes for gauge weight voting

## OXD Token Distribution

- Max Supply: Dynamic, based on total SOLID supply
- 5% minimum to all oxSOLID stakers, but no upper limit
- Partners have a max 25%
- 0-95% to LPs
  - LPs receive the remainder of OXD emissions after distribution to oxSOLID stakers
  - OXD is distributed proportionally to SOLID earned by a given pool
- 0-5% to treasury. Must be voted by vlOXD, defaults to 0%
- o% to 0xDAO team

## OXD Fee Structure

15% total fee on all SOLID revenue generated by SOLIDLY LPs on 0xDAO

- 10% to oxSOLID stakers paid as SOLID
- 5% to vlOXD paid as oxSOLID
- 0-5% to oxSOLID/SOLID and OXD/WFTM LPs paid as oxSOLID. Defaults to 0%, must be voted
- 0-5% treasury, defaults 0%, must be voted

## Notes

A bunch of protocols seem to base their analytics site on the same code base, like <https://info.spookyswap.finance/> â€“ since Solidly's doesn't appear to be public on GitHub and who knows if/when it'll be maintained with handover of the main frontend, maybe check out Spooky's repo and try asking in their Discord, devs are probably helpful: <https://github.com/SpookySwap/spooky-info>

It appears to mostly use The Graph under the hood, a GraphQL API

### Note about DEUS

DEUS is a base layer platform. Other platforms that build on top have to use the DEI stablecoin. Minting DEI burns DEUS, and a portion of fees generated by platforms that build on DEUS get funneled to veDEUS stakers (soon).

Why build on DEUS? A big reason is the MUON oracle. It's way quicker than other Oracles, so can track stock etc prices in real time. Muon+DEI makes it very easy for projects to offer cross chain services as well - cross chain yield farming, lending, trading, etc.
